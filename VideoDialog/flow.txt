### üîπ **1. Data Collection & Preparation**

**Goal:** Get the raw video and caption data into a usable form.

- **Download the dataset**:
    
    Get the videos and captions from ActivityNet and HuggingFace links.
    
- **Parse and clean**:
    - Extract video IDs, start/end timestamps, and captions.
    - Structure the data into records (e.g., JSON or DataFrames) where each unit is a *video moment*.

---

### üîπ **2. Create Initial Index (Text-based Search)**

**Goal:** Build a baseline using standard keyword search in OpenSearch.

- **Define index mappings**:
    - Decide your indexing unit: e.g., `video moment` level.
    - Include fields like `vid_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `caption_bow`, `video_length`, etc.
- **Index the data in OpenSearch**:
    - Use the structured records to populate the OpenSearch index.
    - This enables fast keyword-based retrieval.
- **Test keyword search**:
    - Run a few queries using raw text (e.g., "a person riding a bike") and check what video moments are returned.

---

### üîπ **3. Embedding-Based Index**

**Goal:** Move from keyword search to semantic search using embeddings.

- **Generate embeddings (How?)**:
    - Use a **dual encoder** model (e.g., Sentence-BERT or CLIP's text encoder).
    - For each caption: encode it into a vector.
    - Save these vectors (preferably persistently using Pickle or HDF5).
- **Update OpenSearch index (How?)**:
    - Extend your mappings to include a `caption_vec` (vector field).
    - Re-index the data, this time also including the embeddings.
    - Configure OpenSearch to support **k-NN search** on the embedding vectors.
- **Query embedding (How in real-time?)**:
    - When a user enters a search query, encode it on-the-fly using the same encoder.
    - Use OpenSearch‚Äôs k-NN search to find moments whose `caption_vec` is most similar.

---

### üîπ **4. Search Optimization & Comparison**

**Goal:** Improve retrieval quality and understand trade-offs.

- **Types of search to implement**:
    1. **Text-based only**
    2. **Embedding-based only**
    3. **Boolean filters only** (e.g., filter by entity, video length)
    4. **Hybrid search** (e.g., embedding + filter: ‚Äúfind moments about skiing in short videos‚Äù)
- **How to optimize?**
    - Tweak:
        - Index mappings: maybe reduce unnecessary fields.
        - Filters: test combinations that give better precision.
        - Encoder type: try CLIP vs Sentence-BERT.
    - Evaluate:
        - Create a few test queries + expected answers.
        - Compare results qualitatively and/or using metrics like precision@k.

---

### üîπ **5. Embedding and Attention Analysis**

**Goal:** Understand what‚Äôs going on under the hood.

- **Visualize contextual embeddings**:
    - Track how word embeddings evolve across transformer layers.
- **Analyze attention maps**:
    - Use self-attention visualizers from lab tutorials.
    - Compare attention between cross-encoder and dual encoder.
- **Interpretability**:
    - Show which words/tokens are most attended to and how that relates to query relevance.

---

### üîπ **6. Documentation & Reporting**

**Goal:** Keep a record of the process, results, and insights.

- Document the:
    - Implementation steps.
    - Comparisons (text vs semantic vs filtered).
    - Visualizations and critical analyses.
